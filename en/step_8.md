**Tip:** In this path you will create a snowman, trees, a car, a house, and a rocket. Think about how you could use Array modifiers to create a row of houses or a car park full of cars. 

### More Unity path

The marble texture from this **Blender - Add material effects to a marble** project and the tile floor from the [Blender - Create a 3D tiled floor](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-marble) project can be exported and used in our [More Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/more-unity) path.
