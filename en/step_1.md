In this project, you will make a marble in Blender and create materials that wrap around it.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
One of the amazing uses of <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Blender**</span> is the creations of life-safing 3D printed prosthetics for animals. **Brazillian 3D Designer Cicero Moraes** works with a team of vets and a dental surgeon to create the prosetics. They have helped animals like:
+ Freddy the tortoise who had a shell that was severely damaged by fire 
+ Several toucans, a goose, and a macaw with deformed beaks or beaks damaged in accidents
+ Zeus the puppy who lost a foot after a vicious attack
+ Hannah the Labrador who wasnt eating after loosing a tooth

You will:
+ Use a **UV Sphere** object to create a marble
+ Add a **material** to your marble
+ Adjust the colour **effects** of the marble to personalise it
