## You will make

Use Blender to design and create a marble. Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation package for designers, engineers, and artists.

You will:
+ Use a **UV Sphere** object to create a marble
+ Add textures and colours to design a **material** for your marble
+ Use **Bake** to create a reusable texture image of your material

### Finished marble

You will have lots of opportunities to personalise your marble.

The team have helped animals like:

<br>
🐕 Puppies Zeus, who lost a foot in an attack, and Hanna, who was unable to eat after the loss of a tooth
