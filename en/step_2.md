**Tip:** To navigate Blender using a computer mouse with a middle scroll button:
+ Hold the middle-button down and drag the mouse around to rotate the view
+ Scroll the middle-button forward and backward to zoom in and out of the view

**Tip:** If you do not have a computer mouse with a middle-button you can use the navigation icons. Place the mouse over the **zoom** or **move** icons to see the cursor change to 4 arrows. Hold the left mouse button down then drag the mouse around to change the view.
