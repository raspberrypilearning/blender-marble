## Add procedural textures

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Use **procedural textures** to design your marble material.

Pull up the material window to give you a better view of the material settings:

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**procedural texture**</span> is a texture that has been generated using a set of mathematical rules. Procedural textures are used to make high quality, easily editable, scalable textures that can be added to any surface and still fit together perfectly at the edges.

### Create a Noise texture

--- task ---

Go to 'Add' -> 'Texture' and select 'Noise Texture':

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Place your new **Noise texture** window to the left of the 'Principled BSDF' box:

**Tip**: The new Noise texture window clings to your mouse until you have clicked it into place.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Join the **Noise texture** 'Color' to the **Principled BSDF** 'Base color':

**Tip**: Click and drag from the dot next to 'Color' to the dot next to 'Base color'.

### Combine textures

--- task ---

A material can use more than one texture. 

Go to 'Add' -> 'Texture' and this time select 'Musgrave Texture':

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Place your new **Musgrave texture** window to the left of the **Noise texture** box:

![The 'Musgrave Texture' box has been placed to the left of the 'Noise texture' box.](images/musgrave-left.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Join the **Musgrave texture** 'Height' to the **Noise Texture** 'Vector':

![The 'Height' property in the Musgrave Texture box has been dragged to join the 'Vector' property in the Noise texture box.](images/join-textures.png)

**Tip**: Click and drag from the dot next to 'Height' to the dot next to 'Vector'.

### Customise your material

--- task ---

Adjust the 'Vector' settings in the **Musgrave Texture** and **Noise texture** until you are happy with the look of your marble:
