## Add procedural textures

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Use **procedural textures** to design your marble material.

Pull the material window up to give you a better view of the material settings:

**Tip:** Move your mouse to the edge of the window. The cursor will change to a double arrow. Click and drag the window up.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**procedural texture**</span> is a texture that has been generated using a set of mathematical rules. Procedural textures are used to make high-quality, easily editable, scalable textures that can be added to any surface and still fit together perfectly at the edges.

### Create a Noise Texture

--- task ---

Go to **Add** > **Texture** and select **Noise Texture**:

--- task ---

Place your new **Noise Texture** box to the left of the **Principled BSDF** box:

**Tip**: The new Noise Texture box clings to your cursor until you have clicked it into place.

Join the Noise Texture **Color** to the Principled BSDF **Base Color**:

### Combine textures

--- task ---

A material can use more than one texture.

Go to **Add** > **Texture** and this time select **Musgrave Texture**:

![The Add menu open, with 'Texture' then 'Musgrave Texture' highlighted.](images/musgrave-texture.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Place your new **Musgrave Texture** box to the left of the **Noise Texture** box:

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Join the Musgrave Texture **Height** to the Noise Texture **Vector**:

![The Height property in the Musgrave Texture box joined to the Vector property in the Noise Texture box.](images/join-textures.png)

**Tip:** Click and drag from the dot next to **Height** to the dot next to **Vector**.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Notice:** ðŸ‘€ The material on the sphere has changed again:

### Customise your material

--- task ---

Adjust the **Vector** settings in the **Musgrave Texture** and **Noise Texture** boxes until you are happy with the look of your marble:
