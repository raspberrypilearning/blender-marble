## Use your material in Blender

### Blender animation path

Our [Blender basics](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/blender-basics) path covers how to create, animate, and render 3D objects and scenes to make a snow scene animation:

**Tip:** Your snow scene animation will include a snowman, trees, a car, a house, and a rocket. Think about how you could use your new material:

### Blender: Create a 3D tiled floor

The marble texture from this **Blender: Add material effects to a marble** project and the tiled floor from the [Blender: Create a 3D tiled floor](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-tiled-floor) project can be exported and used in our [More Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/more-unity) path.

**Tip:** If you have not used Unity before, you can start with our [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro) path, in which you will learn how to make 3D worlds with quests and games.
