Add different textures. Experiment with texture order and joins to see what patterns you can create.

You could try the **Wave Texture**:

![A 3D sphere with a multicoloured wave effect. In the material window, the Wave Texture box is joined to the ColorRamp box.](images/wave-texture.png)

Or the **Brick Texture**:

![A 3D sphere with a multicoloured brick effect. In the material window, the Brick Texture box is joined to the ColorRamp box.](images/brick-texture.png)

Or both together!
